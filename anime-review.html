                        absolutely best anime to ever exist. perfect example of how to make an anime with minimal fanservice, everything relying on the plot which
                        hits hard. characters are super memorable too. well done

                        absolutely the best anime out there, the music is fantastic, the story it tells is really touching.
                        its just peak bro, would cry again <br>
                        <br>
                        like, imagine bocchi the rock but its actually 500% more serious and has deep story that will make you feel something <br>
                        <br>
                        just peak.

                        another banger too, although it starts off super slow and you gotta endure like first 4-5 episodes before getting to the real stuff.
                        i found it rather funny at times, HOWEVER, the professor (hakase) is literally the most obnoxious and worst character in the entire show
                        seriously i wanted to drop the entire anime because of her. <br><br>
                        also i really liked the huge cast of characters! seriously, every other anime i see is usually about girls but in nichijou you have both
                        boys and girls

                        really nice show! really liked the idea of having literally 2 main characters (with occasionally episodic ones)
                        explore stuff for like 12 episodes, each episode bringing something new to the table - e.g. new questions, new activities n such - 
                        even if it meant staying in the nuclear winter

                        it's something between average and good. nothing more than ordinary girls doing ordinary stuff which stretches out to like 24 episodes

                        well so far the anime is pretty so-so. the story is fine, the characters are good too but and it was sometimes funny too.

                        the only thing i found cool about the whole show is the OST, the rest of it is just "plot"
