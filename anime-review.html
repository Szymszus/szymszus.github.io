                        absolutely best anime to ever exist. perfect example of how to make an anime with minimal fanservice, everything relying on the plot which
                        hits hard. characters are super memorable too. well done

                        another banger too, although it starts off super slow and you gotta endure like first 4-5 episodes before getting to the real stuff.
                        i found it rather funny at times, HOWEVER, the professor (hakase) is literally the most obnoxious and worst character in the entire show
                        seriously i wanted to drop the entire anime because of her

                    <li>my opinion so far: <br><br>
                        it's something between average and good. nothing more than ordinary girls doing ordinary stuff which stretches out to like 24 episodes

                        really nice show! really liked the idea of having literally 2 main characters (with occasionally episodic ones)
                        explore stuff for like 12 episodes, each episode bringing something new to the table - e.g. new questions, new activities n such - 
                        even if it meant staying in the nuclear winter

                        what the fuck??? fanservice with a character thats probably struggling with algebra??????? <br>
                        the only thing i found cool about the whole show is the OST, the rest of it is just "plot"

        </ul>
        its just a random silly order, im not watching the shows from top to bottom and may pick randomly based on what seems more interesting to me <br><br>
        also i didnt really put as much effort into making this site because this was supposed to be a silly list from the beginning
