                <b>hi! im szy (aka szymszus elsewhere)</b> <br> <br>
                who am i? you may ask... well, to answer your question, im an ordinary human being, just like you!... at least i hope i am... <br> <br>
                i really enjoy learning about programming, making games to be exact! i also know a thing or two about pixel art and sometimes (he meant rarely)
                draw stuff i think is cool. <br> <br>
                i also, much like any other person, i enjoy playing games to be exact, though i usually play indie games, but ive got a bit of everything
                in my steam library (i also own a nintendo switch and playstation 4 but i barely use them). i also sometimes watch anime, mainly stuff that
                my friends recommend <br> <br>
                im also not a talkative person and i usually just talk to people when they talk to me first. <i>like an NPC...</i>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 48px;"><b>alright time for some questions</b></p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 32px;"><b>why did you even make a website???</b></p>
        <p class="answers">
            <b>picture this:</b> <br>
            most social media or other platforms usually have like approx. 150 characters you can use to describe yourself which means you need to compress
            facts, information, likes/dislikes or anything you want the public to know. the problem is, 150 characters is way too little for me and i want to
            express myself more
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 32px;"><b>why a programmer???</b></p>
        <p class="answers">
            dont really know honestly, i just got introduced to programming courses at one point. i was literally like "yeah i will give the courses a shot" and this is
            where i am now, making games in godot
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 32px;"><b>why an artist???</b></p>
        <p class="answers">
            i started learning art very recently (2022 to be exact) mainly because i got an idea for a game and i didnt
            feel like bothering skilled artists with my ideas for assets i wont even use because of my little programming experience back then.
            so i just launched paint <i>yes literally ms paint</i> and started drawing random assets for my "game" which i found fun, since it kept me 
            thinking about new assets while i was placing pixels on the canvas. today im using aseprite for assets for my games im making
