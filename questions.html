            <div class="custom-header">WHY MAKE A WEBSITE?</div>
            <p>
                well, one main reason i made a website was that many about mes on various social media give you little to no space to describe yourself.
                i wanted a website to put all the "fun" facts about me if you were curious. regardless this website could be my future portfolio just in case

            <p>
                <a href="https://szymszus.me">szymszus.me</a> looks much cleaner on the eye than whatever free site hosting services would give. i feel like
                having a domain feels more professional too and makes me look cooler... THERE!! i admitted it......

            <div class="custom-header">WHY BE A PROGRAMMER?</div>
            <p>
                honestly i dunno myself. i guess its because that one time i signed for programming courses (html/css/js -> python -> c#) and i really liked it.
                plus, i heard that people currently give a good penny for programming jobs and all. i changed my mind and just decided to be a game dev
                and make games in this <a href="https://godotengine.org/">engine with a silly robot as a logo</a>

            <div class="custom-header">WHY BE A WHY AN ARTIST?</div>
            <p>
                at one point (late 2022) i wanted to make a game... the thing was though... i didnt really have any experience with making games back then,
                so i didnt want to bother other artists with my commisions and all with my silly projects (also i had no spare money back then) and just
                decided to open ms paint (yes, literally) and draw some pixel art (i thought itd be easier) there. this is where i am now, drawing
                stuff in <a href="https://aseprite.org">aseprite</a>
