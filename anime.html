        <p>
            this is where i put anime i watched/am watching and occasionally rant about it. i really enjoy watching slice-of-life, comedy shows
            so if you got those, recommend them to me! <br> <br>
            also keep in mind that whatever posters you see there next to reviews WERE NOT drawn by me!!! their only purpose on this site is to provide
            reference to the user. every poster near the review boxes belongs to its original owner/producer/illustrator AND NOT ME (szymszus)!!!

                honestly, one of the better shows ive ever watched. does tell a cool story, has really nice jokes here and there. 
                great anime if youre looking for a show with near-zero fanservice, great storytelling, some comedy and great music

                if you dont want to watch a funny show about a band (bocchi the rock), pick this one. this anime is really great, its as if bocchi the rock
                had a completely different cast of characters, every one of them having a well-written backstory. one of the more emotional shows ive ever watched

                funny anime that doesnt have a strict plot line, instead its just a set of stories that try to make you laugh. some scenes really did make me laugh
                with all honesty. although im not giving this show 5/5 because hakase is literally the worst character imaginable yeah i get it shes just a 8-year-old kid but still shes really annoying, especially with all the changes she does to poor nano.. <br> <br>
                tho if you want a good laugh, sure, i recommend this to you

                this show is really good. dunno what to say about it really but i really liked the idea of two girls wandering around post-apocalyptic world.
                even though it stretches to 12 episodes, i never felt bored watching it! <br> <br>
                i know theres probably some deep lore about the world but... i didnt really bother to dig it up

                well... yeah, its pretty good! its a really lighthearted show with really neat looking animation with some jokes here and there! what i liked
                about the show is that from the 1st episode, within first minutes of the show youre introduced to sacchan's (mc) goal and how she even got there!
                though, theres too many hot springs scenes, i dont really know why. but i guess for the story and animation i would recommend it!

                meh, i mean its sometimes funny but most of the time its just... boring. i mean all the anime is really about is just some girls doing
                stuff. characters are okay-ish, their interactions are good but... i guess ill watch it when i have spare time

                REVIEW: <br>
                i could lash out about it but ill take things calmly. <br>
                i heard from other friends that the show is really good, the thing is... theres just WAAAAYY too much fanservice, and the main character
                is literally a middle schooler! i really felt uncomfortable watching it, thats why i dropped it after the first episode. <br> <br>
                0.5/5 mainly because the music is good. thats the only thing i like
